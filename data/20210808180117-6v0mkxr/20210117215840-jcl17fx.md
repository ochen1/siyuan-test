# Data Security

## Overview

Data security is mainly divided into two aspects:

- Availability[^1]: no data loss, keep the data complete and consistent
- Confidentiality: data will not be leaked or tampered with

SiYuan supports both of these aspects. The following is an explanation about data security.

## Plaintext storage

SiYuan uses plaintext to store data on the local file system, which means:

- Anyone or software who can use the operating system can read the data in it
- The availability of data depends on the availability of hardware disks and operating systems

## End-to-end encryption

SiYuan cloud synchronization use End-to-end Encryption[^11], the password is stored locally with a built-in key encryption, any third party other than the user cannot get the plaintext in the cloud data.

## Suggest

- Regularly back up data, refer to 321 Backup Guidelines (Minimum 3 copies, 2 media, and 1 offline storage)
- It is recommended to use special software, equipment or offline storage for important passwords, keys or core secrets

## Threat Model

It mainly evaluates local data security and SiYuan cloud storage security.

### Premise

- The local host operating system is a fully trusted environment. This is the most basic premise of data security, and it can only be guaranteed based on this premise.

  - Availability of original data
  - Rriginal data is not leaked
  - Key security
- Users do not leak keys to attackers
- Data in cloud storage will not be deleted
- AES-GCM encryption algorithm is not broken
- The attacker cannot provide the computing power required for brute force cracking

### Cloud storage can guarantee

- Data can only be decrypted with the correct key
- Data cannot be decrypted after being tampered with

### Normal example

Based on the above premises and guarantees, the following are examples of what an attacker can achieve.

If an attacker has read-only access to cloud storage, he can:

- Get the encrypted data and try brute force cracking
- Infer data size from index information

If an attacker is able to hijack the network, then he can:

- Tampering with data makes data unavailable
- Get user ID information
- Infer data size from traffic

### Exception example

If the above premises or guarantees are violated, the following are examples of what an attacker can achieve.

If an attacker is able to compromise the local host operating system, then he can:

- Modify or delete the original data, making the original data unavailable
- Get original data
- Get the key

If an attacker has write access to cloud storage, he can:

- Modify or delete cloud storage, causing cloud storage data to be unavailable

[^1]: # Data Availability Guarantee

    ## Local device

    We've put a lot of effort into improving data availability on local devices:

    - The content changes in the editor will be automatically saved to the disk, and the actual writing time to the disk will vary according to the size of the document. Usually, the final save will be completed within 1 second
    - Support File history[^2]
    - Support Data snapshot[^10]
    - Support complete export and import of Data compressed package
    - It is forbidden to synchronize data through third-party sync disk software to avoid file damage

    Through these efforts, we have tried our best to ensure the availability of data on the local device. But please note that the premise of these guarantees is that the device disk is free from failures and accidents.

    ## Cloud sync

    It is not enough to improve the availability of data on the local device, because the cloud data synchronization[^7] is one of the rigid requirements. Data synchronization will affect local device data, so we should try our best to ensure the availability of data after synchronization:

    - Generate a data snapshot before synchronization, if unexpected synchronization results occur, you can roll back through the snapshot
    - If a file conflict occurs during synchronization

      - Automatically generate file history, you can roll back through file history
      - You can also enable  <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Generate conflict documentation when syncing conflicts</kbd>​
    - Support browsing and downloading cloud snapshots in <kbd>Data History</kbd> - <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud snapshot</kbd>​

    ## Summarize

    Through the above safeguards, we hope you will no longer have too many concerns about data availability, please feel free to use it.

    Nevertheless, we still recommend that you refer to the 321 Backup Guidelines (Minimum 3 copies, 2 media, and 1 offline storage).

    Welcome to give us more feedback and suggestions, data availability is the top priority, and we look forward to continuously improving it with everyone's efforts.


[^2]: ## File history

    ### File history generation rules

    - Every 10 minutes, a history will be generated for the documents updated within these 10 minutes (the interval can be set by <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Generation Interval</kbd> make adjustments), and the suffix of the history folder is `-update`​
    - When synchronizing in the cloud, the local data covered by the cloud will generate a history, and the suffix of the history folder is `-sync`​
    - History will be generated when manually deleting notebooks, documents and assets, and the suffix of the history folder is `-delete`​
    - When using Cleanup unreferenced assets[^3], a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-clean`​
    - When using the Optimize typography[^5], a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-format`​
    - When using <kbd>Search replace</kbd>, a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-replace`​
    - When dragging an outline item in the outline panel, a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-outline`​


[^3]: ## Cleanup unreferenced assets

    A "Reference" refers to a link to a asset file via a hyperlink, an inserted image, or the `src` attribute of an HTML tag (such as `<img>`, `<iframe>`). There are two cases here:

    1. Reference to a specific asset file, such as a picture or a file
    2. Reference to a asset folder (a subfolder under the assets folder) must end with `/`, such as `[foo](assets/bar/)`. If a asset folder is referenced, all the following asset files will be counted as already referenced regardless of whether they are individually referenced

    In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, you can clean up unreferenced assets by one-click. If you need to retrieve files that have been deleted by mistake, please via Rollback[^4].

    ​#Note#: Using absolute paths (local or network paths) will not be included Clean up calculations.


[^4]: ## Rollback through file history

    In the time list column on the left side of the data history interface, there is a rollback button on the right side of each history record. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing file will be overwritten with the file history.

    If there are very many files that need to be rolled back, it is recommended to manually copy on the file system. The internal structure of the history folder is the same as the internal structure of data, for example:

    - Notebook delete: `2022-05-01-091021-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/`, i.e. `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/`
    - Document deletion: `2022-05-01-091209-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/20200812220555-lj3enxa.sy`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/{document path}`
    - Asset file cleanup: `2022-05-01-095621-clean/assets/image-20220501091157-qccp87e.png`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/assets/{asset file name}`

    Manual rollback steps:

    1. Exit SiYuan, and then make a full copy and backup of the entire workspace to avoid data loss caused by subsequent misoperations
    2. Go to the `workspace/history/` folder and copy the data in the `historical generation date-{operation}` folder directly to the data folder for overwriting
    3. Reindex manually after starting SiYuan

    ### Clean up file history

    By default, the history of files generated in the last 30 days is automatically saved, which can be adjusted through <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Retention Days</kbd>. History will be automatically deleted.

    If you want to clear all file history data, you can click <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>Clear all history</kbd>, or manually delete the `workspace/history/` folder, then <kbd>Reindex</kbd> in <kbd>File History</kbd>.


[^5]: # Optimize typography

    ## Overview

    In order to record the content quickly, we often ignore some typographic details, such as the lack of spaces before and after inline codes or bolds, and the lack of spaces between Chinese and Western texts.

    This will cause the content typography to look less refined, and there will be some visual distraction when browsing the content in the future. Of course, this is just our feeling, maybe this is not a problem, and even such a compact typesetting is needed in the first place.

    ## How to use

    Select <kbd>Optimized Typesetting</kbd> in the <kbd>︙</kbd> menu in the upper right corner of the editor. After processing, a space will be automatically inserted before and after the following elements in the document:

    - Inline code: `Code`​
    - Inline formula: $a^2 + b^2 = \color{red}c^2$

    In addition, a space will be automatically inserted between Chinese and Western languages in the following elements:

    - ==Mark==
    - ~~Strikethrough~~
    - [Hyperlink anchor text](https://liuyun.io)
    - Normal text
    - *Italic*
    - **Bold**

    ## Automatic backup

    Before the actual execution of optimized typesetting, SiYuan will automatically back up the original document once, so that if the optimization result is not satisfied, it can be rolled back through Data history[^6].


[^6]: # Data history

    ## Overview

    Data history is mainly used to ensure data security, and even if a misoperation occurs, data can be rolled back through history. The data history is divided into two functions:

    - File history: saved in the `workspace/history/` folder as the original file, human-readable, and can be manually copied to the corresponding location of data for recovery
    - Data snapshot: partitioned by file, encrypted and compressed and saved in the `workspace/repo/` folder, unreadable by humans and cannot be manually restored

    In addition to local data history, data snapshots are also used for cloud data synchronization[^7].

    ## File history

    ### File history generation rules

    - Every 10 minutes, a history will be generated for the documents updated within these 10 minutes (the interval can be set by <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Generation Interval</kbd> make adjustments), and the suffix of the history folder is `-update`​
    - When synchronizing in the cloud, the local data covered by the cloud will generate a history, and the suffix of the history folder is `-sync`​
    - History will be generated when manually deleting notebooks, documents and assets, and the suffix of the history folder is `-delete`​
    - When using Cleanup unreferenced assets[^3], a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-clean`​
    - When using the Optimize typography[^5], a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-format`​
    - When using <kbd>Search replace</kbd>, a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-replace`​
    - When dragging an outline item in the outline panel, a history will be generated, and the suffix of the history folder is `-outline`​

    ## Browse file history

    - Click the <kbd>Data History</kbd> button on the top toolbar or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to open the data history interface, switch to the <kbd>File History</kbd> tab, if no historical data is displayed , you can try <kbd>Reindex</kbd> of this interface
    - Browse under the filesystem `workspace/history/` folder

    ## Rollback through file history

    In the time list column on the left side of the data history interface, there is a rollback button on the right side of each history record. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing file will be overwritten with the file history.

    If there are very many files that need to be rolled back, it is recommended to manually copy on the file system. The internal structure of the history folder is the same as the internal structure of data, for example:

    - Notebook delete: `2022-05-01-091021-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/`, i.e. `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/`
    - Document deletion: `2022-05-01-091209-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/20200812220555-lj3enxa.sy`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/{document path}`
    - Asset file cleanup: `2022-05-01-095621-clean/assets/image-20220501091157-qccp87e.png`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/assets/{asset file name}`

    Manual rollback steps:

    1. Exit SiYuan, and then make a full copy and backup of the entire workspace to avoid data loss caused by subsequent misoperations
    2. Go to the `workspace/history/` folder and copy the data in the `historical generation date-{operation}` folder directly to the data folder for overwriting
    3. Reindex manually after starting SiYuan

    ### Clean up file history

    By default, the history of files generated in the last 30 days is automatically saved, which can be adjusted through <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Retention Days</kbd>. History will be automatically deleted.

    If you want to clear all file history data, you can click <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>Clear all history</kbd>, or manually delete the `workspace/history/` folder, then <kbd>Reindex</kbd> in <kbd>File History</kbd>.

    ## Data snapshot

    ### Initialize key

    Before using the data snapshot for the first time, you need to initialize the <kbd>Data repo key</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>.

    There are three ways to initialize the key:

    - <kbd>Import Key</kbd>: Copy the key string from another device to this paste and import
    - <kbd>Auto-generate key</kbd>: Use random text to generate the key, this method only needs to be executed once on one device, and other devices use <kbd>Import key</kbd>
    - <kbd>Generate key by passphrase</kbd>: Use a custom passphrase to generate the key, which requires the same passphrase on all devices

    All in all, it is important to ensure that all devices use the same key, otherwise data snapshots will not be available across devices, such as syncing data snapshots through the cloud.

    ### Create data snapshot

    1. Click the <kbd>Data History</kbd> button on the top toolbar or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to open the data history interface
    2. Switch to the last tab <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd>
    3. Click <kbd>Create Snapshot</kbd>, fill in <kbd>Memo</kbd> and confirm

    When browsing data snapshots, you can only distinguish between the snapshot creation time and memo, so the memo should be as detailed as possible, so that different data snapshots can be accurately identified in the future.

    ### Browse data snapshot

    After creating a data snapshot, you can see the snapshot time list on the left, and click different snapshots to browse their notes.

    ### Rollback data snapshot

    There is a rollback button on the right side of the snapshot time list entry. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing data will be completely replaced with the snapshot data.

    ### Cleanup data snapshot

    - ​<kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd> - <kbd>Data repo purge</kbd> will delete all unreferenced snapshots and related data objects. "Referenced snapshots" refer to snapshots pointed to under repo/refs/:

      - ​`latest` points to the latest snapshot
      - ​`tags/*` point to manually tagged snapshots
    - Manually delete the `workspace/repo/` folder to clear all data snapshots

    ### Ignore files

    If you need to ignore some files during synchronization, please create or edit the text file `workspace/data/.siyuan/syncignore` on the file system, each line is configured with the relative path of the data folder, which means that the path of the file or folder is ignored and wildcard characters are supported. E.g:

    - `20210808180117-6v0mkxr/**/*`: Ignore the data/20210808180117-6v0mkxr notebook
    - `assets/*.pdf`: ignore PDF files under data/assets/

    ### #Note#

    - Symlinks and hidden files are not snapshotted


[^7]: # Data sync

    ## Overview

    Data synchronization refers to keeping the `workspace/data/` folder data consistent on multiple devices, includes assets, custom icons, plugins, code snippets, templates, widgets, and document data.

    ## How to use

    After initializing the data repo key[^8], if all goes well, the synchronization is already configured. If you are not familiar with synchronization configuration, it is recommended to open the synchronization configuration wizard by clicking the synchronization button. It is easier to configure through the wizard.

    - If you need to pause sync, you can turn off the option <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Enable cloud sync</kbd>
    - Ignore files[^9]

    ​#Note#​: 

    - Before enabling synchronization, please ensure that the system time of all devices participating in the synchronization is consistent
    - If the amount of data is large, it is recommended to export the data package through <kbd>Export Data</kbd> in the settings, and then send the data package to the new device by manual copying or other methods, and export the data package on the new device. Go to <kbd>Import Data</kbd>, and finally configure synchronization

    ## Synchronous mode

    Three synchronization modes are supported in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud Sync Mode</kbd>:

    - Auto

      - A synchronization will be performed when starting and exiting, and a synchronization will be performed 30 seconds after the data in use is no longer changed
      - Data merging and overwriting are determined by the synchronization algorithm, please refer to the following working principle introduction
    - Manual

      - Only one synchronization is performed when starting and exiting, and manual triggering of synchronization is required during use
      - Data merging and overwriting are determined by the synchronization algorithm, please refer to the following working principle introduction
    - Full manual sync: no sync at startup and exit, fully manual control of sync timing and sync direction

    ## How Auto/Manual mode works

    SiYuan performs corresponding operations by comparing cloud data snapshots and local data snapshots:

    - If the snapshots are the same, ignore this synchronization
    - If the snapshots are different, upload the local changes from the last sync to the cloud, and merge the latest changes from the cloud to the local

      - Merge directly if there is no conflict between the changes at both ends
      - If there is a file conflict, the local will overwrite the cloud, and the conflicting files from the cloud will be generated in the data history.

    The automatic synchronization time interval algorithm is described as follows:

    - After 30 seconds of data change, if there is no further change, a comparison will be made, and if it continues to change, it will be delayed by 30 seconds
    - If there is no data change, it will be incremented by 5 minutes, 8 minutes, 16 minutes, 32 minutes...

    ## Scenario example

    From the above working principle, we can know that SiYuan only supports alternate synchronization of data on multiple devices: after synchronization is completed on device A, synchronization is performed on device B. Simultaneous synchronization of multiple devices cannot be supported, so unexpected data overwriting will occur.

    ### Normal scenario

    1. Execute synchronization after editing on device A (by triggering synchronization automatically or manually), at this time, the cloud data will be overwritten by the data of device A, that is, the cloud and device A keep the same data
    2. Execute synchronization on device B. At this time, the data of device B will be overwritten by the cloud data, that is, the cloud and devices A and B keep the same data
    3. After editing on device B, perform synchronization again. At this time, the cloud data will be overwritten by device B data, that is, the cloud and device B keep the same data.
    4. Execute synchronization on device A. At this time, the data of device A will be overwritten by the cloud data, that is, the cloud and devices A and B keep the same data

    In this scenario, the process of using synchronization is performed alternately on devices A and B, which can ensure that data synchronization is completed normally as expected.

    ### Conflict scenario

    1. Sync after editing the file a on device A
    2. Sync after editing the file a on device B
    3. At this time, the cloud file a will be overwritten by a of the B device, and the history of the previous A device file a will be generated on the B device

    ## #Note#

    - Synchronization will not be triggered in the case of sudden disconnection such as sleep or shutdown, please manually click the synchronization button to synchronize
    - Do not use a third-party sync disk and SiYuan sync at the same time, it may cause data damage
    - Symbolic links and hidden files will not be synchronized
    - In the automatic synchronization mode, if you need to exit, please use the normal exit method (for example, do not use sliding to remove on the mobile APP, do not use the end process to force close on the desktop) to ensure data sync
    - If the data snapshot takes more than 12 seconds before data synchronization, you will be prompted to clean up the data warehouse. If you need to change the default time, you can use the following two methods.

      - Environment variable `SIYUAN_SYNC_INDEX_TIMING`, for example `SIYUAN_SYNC_INDEX_TIMING=30000`, the unit is milliseconds
      - Directly modify `repo.syncIndexTiming` in workspace/conf/conf.json

      The minimum value can only be configured to `12000` (12 seconds), and the maximum value is not limited; when starting, environment variables will be read first to overwrite the values in the conf file.


[^8]: ### Initialize key

    Before using the data snapshot for the first time, you need to initialize the <kbd>Data repo key</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>.

[^9]: ### Ignore files

    If you need to ignore some files during synchronization, please create or edit the text file `workspace/data/.siyuan/syncignore` on the file system, each line is configured with the relative path of the data folder, which means that the path of the file or folder is ignored and wildcard characters are supported. E.g:

    - `20210808180117-6v0mkxr/**/*`: Ignore the data/20210808180117-6v0mkxr notebook
    - `assets/*.pdf`: ignore PDF files under data/assets/

[^11]: ## End-to-end Encryption

    Data synchronization is transmitted through end-to-end encryption, and the cloud does not store any plaintext data.

    - The key is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to the cloud
    - Encryption and decryption process is performed entirely on the local device
    - The encryption algorithm is the industry-recognized and secure AES GCM
