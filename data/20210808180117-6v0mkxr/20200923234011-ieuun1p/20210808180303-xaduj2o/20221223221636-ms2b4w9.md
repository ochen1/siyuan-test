# Flashcards

## Overview

After setting the content block as a flashcard, it will automatically arrange the review through the spaced repetition algorithm FSRS (github repo: open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler).

## How to use

### Content Block

Before starting the official card making, let us introduce some basic rules of card making:

- ==mark== elements in content blocks will be treated as knockout answers
- If a super block is set as a flashcard, the first sub-block of the super block will be regarded as a question, and the rest of the sub-blocks will be regarded as an answer
- If a list or list item is set as a flashcard, non-sublists will be treated as questions and sublists will be treated as answers
- If a heading block is set as a flashcard, the heading block will be treated as a question and the blocks below it will be treated answers

The above rules can be adjusted in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>.

### Based on doc

The document-based usage method does not need to pay attention to the card deck, and supports parent-child document review.

- Select <kbd>Quick make card</kbd> in the block icon menu to make a card
- Right-click the doc in the document tree panel or click the document block icon <kbd>Flashcard</kbd> in the editor to enter the review

### Based on card deck

Based on the use of card deck, the content blocks in different documents can be carded and put into a unified card pack for review.

- Select <kbd>Add to card deck...</kbd>​ in the block label menu, and then add the content block to a card deck to complete the card making
- Access review by clicking <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>​ in the top bar menu

This mode of use is disabled by default. If necessary, it can be enabled in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd> - <kbd>Deck</kbd>. However, it is not recommended to use flashcards based on card deck, because the card deck are fixed and not as flexible as using flashcards based on documents.

## Settings

You can adjust the global configuration related to flashcards in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>, including <kbd>New Card Limit</kbd> and <kbd>Old Card Limit</kbd> can be overridden using document block custom attributes:

- ​`riff-new-card-limit`​
- ​`riff-review-card-limit`​

They are configured separately on different documents and do not affect each other. For example, if the parent document is configured as 5 and the sub-document is 10, then it will be 5 when reviewing from the parent document, and the configuration of the sub-document will not be superimposed.

## ​#Note#​

- After the content block is deleted (or the ID is changed), the corresponding flashcard will become invalid
- It is not recommended to enable card decks. This method has been deprecated. If you continue to use it, you may encounter unsolvable problems

## Technical implementation

- The card deck data is stored in the `workspace/data/storage/riff/` folder through the MessagePack serialization protocol
- Load all card deck data to the memory at startup, and reload once after the data is downloaded synchronously
