# Docker hosting

## Overview

The easiest way to serve SiYuan on a server is to deploy it through Docker.

- Image name `b3log/siyuan`
- [Image URL](https://hub.docker.com/r/b3log/siyuan)

## File structure

The overall program is located under `/opt/siyuan/`, which is basically the structure under the resources folder of the Electron installation package:

- appearance: icon, theme, languages
- guide: user guide document
- stage: interface and static resources
- kernel: kernel program

## Entrypoint

The entry point is set when building the Docker image: `ENTRYPOINT ["/opt/siyuan/kernel" ]`, use `docker run b3log/siyuan` with parameters to start:

- `--workspace` specifies the workspace folder path, mounted to the container via `-v` on the host

More parameters can refer to here[^1]. The following is an example of a startup command: `docker run -d -v workspace_dir_host:workspace_dir_container -p 6806:6806 b3log/siyuan --workspace=workspace_dir_container`​

- `workspace_dir_host`: the workspace folder path on the host
- `workspace_dir_container`: The path of the workspace folder in the container, which is the same as specified in `--workspace`

To simplify, it is recommended to configure the workspace folder path to be consistent on the host and container, such as: `workspace_dir_host` and `workspace_dir_container` are configured as `/siyuan/workspace`, the corresponding startup commands is: `docker run -d -v /siyuan/workspace:/siyuan/workspace -p 6806:6806 -u 1000:1000 b3log/siyuan --workspace=/siyuan/workspace/`.

## User permissions

In the image, the normal user `siyuan` (uid 1000/gid 1000) created by default is used to start the kernel process. Therefore, when the host creates a workspace folder, please pay attention to setting the user group of the folder:  `chown -R 1000:1000 /siyuan/workspace`. The parameter `-u 1000:1000` is required when starting the container.

## Hidden port

Use NGINX reverse proxy to hide port 6806, please note:

- Configure WebSocket reverse proxy `/ws`

## #Note#​

- Be sure to confirm the correctness of the mounted volume, otherwise the data will be lost after the container is deleted
- Do not use URL rewriting for redirection, otherwise there may be problems with authentication, it is recommended to configure a reverse proxy

## Limitations

- Does not support desktop and mobile application connections, only supports use on browsers
- Export to PDF, HTML and Word formats is not supported
- Import Markdown file is not supported

[^1]: # Kernel parameter

    ### `--workspace`

    Used to specify the workspace folder path, the default value when not specified is `~/SiYuan/`.

    ### `--wd`

    Kernel working directory path, automatically obtained according to the kernel executable file entry if it is not specified.

    ### `--readonly`

    After specifying with `--readonly=true`, the kernel will run in read-only mode and all write operations will be prohibited.

    ### `--accessAuthCode`

    Used to specify the browser access authentication password[^2], which will overwrite the authCode in conf.json after setting.

    ### `--ssl`

    After using `--ssl=true`, https and wss protocols will be used for serving.

    ### `--lang`

    Using `--lang=zh_CN` will use Simplified Chinese to initialize the appearance language, the default is `en_US`. Currently available values: `zh_CN`, `zh_CHT`, `en_US` and `fr_FR`.

    ### `--mode`

    Use `--mode=dev` to run in development mode, use `--mode=prod` to run in production mode, default `prod`.

    The main difference between development mode and production mode is that development mode uses `working directory/appearance/` as the appearance folder, while production mode uses `workspace/conf/appearance/`.

    ### `--port`​

    Used to specify the listening port, when not specified:

    - Use random port on desktop
    - Docker/mobile uses `6806`​


[^2]: In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>, you can configure the browser access authentication password. Leaving it blank means that authentication is not enabled. This is more useful in open networks (such as office spaces and public networks), and only after authentication can you enter the work space.
