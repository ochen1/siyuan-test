# Kernel parameter

### `--workspace`

Used to specify the workspace folder path, the default value when not specified is `~/SiYuan/`.

### `--wd`

Kernel working directory path, automatically obtained according to the kernel executable file entry if it is not specified.

### `--readonly`

After specifying with `--readonly=true`, the kernel will run in read-only mode and all write operations will be prohibited.

### `--accessAuthCode`

Used to specify the browser access authentication password[^1], which will overwrite the authCode in conf.json after setting.

### `--ssl`

After using `--ssl=true`, https and wss protocols will be used for serving.

### `--lang`

Using `--lang=zh_CN` will use Simplified Chinese to initialize the appearance language, the default is `en_US`. Currently available values: `zh_CN`, `zh_CHT`, `en_US` and `fr_FR`.

### `--mode`

Use `--mode=dev` to run in development mode, use `--mode=prod` to run in production mode, default `prod`.

The main difference between development mode and production mode is that development mode uses `working directory/appearance/` as the appearance folder, while production mode uses `workspace/conf/appearance/`.

### `--port`​

Used to specify the listening port, when not specified:

- Use random port on desktop
- Docker/mobile uses `6806`​

[^1]: In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>, you can configure the browser access authentication password. Leaving it blank means that authentication is not enabled. This is more useful in open networks (such as office spaces and public networks), and only after authentication can you enter the work space.
