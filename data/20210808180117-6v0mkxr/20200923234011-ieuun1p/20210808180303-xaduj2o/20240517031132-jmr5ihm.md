# Publish service

## Overview

Joplin supports publishing the content of the current workspace in read-only mode on the local area network.

## Usage

- Open <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Publish</kbd> to enter the publishing service settings panel.
- Set the <kbd>Server port</kbd>​

  - The default port number is `6808`.
  - If the port number is set to `0`, a random port will be used.
- If access control is required for the publishing service:

  - Add <kbd>Authenticated accounts</kbd> and enable the <kbd>Service basic authentication</kbd> switch.
  - When enabled, the publishing service will use the [Basic authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication#basic_authentication_scheme) to authenticate visitors.

    - Visitors must enter the username and password set in the "Authentication Accounts" before browsing the published content.
- Enable the <kbd>Publish service</kbd> switch.

## #Note#​

- After enabling the publishing service, visitors can browse the content of the entire workspace.
- When <kbd>Service basic authentication</kbd> is disabled, all visitors can browse the content of the entire workspace without authentication.
