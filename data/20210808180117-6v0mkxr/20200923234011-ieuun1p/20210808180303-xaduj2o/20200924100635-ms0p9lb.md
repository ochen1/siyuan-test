# Bookmark and Tag

## Bookmark

If you need to "favorite" content blocks, please open the attribute panel through the block icon menu, and then you can set bookmarks in the attribute panel.

All favorite content blocks will be listed in the bookmark tab (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd> / <kbd>⌃3</kbd>). If you want to cancel the collection, select Delete in the drop-down menu of the content block ID.

## Tag

The tag is used to mark the block in the content block. The syntax is to wrap the tag identifier with two `#` in the first and one after the other, like this `#Tag#`.

Tag support hierarchical levels, so that content blocks can be sorted more easily. Use `/` to separate different levels, like this `#A/B/C#`.

All tagged content blocks will be listed in the tag tab (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>4</kbd> / <kbd>⌃4</kbd>). If you need to cancel the tag, just delete the tag in the content block.

## #Note#​

Please do not use special symbols in bookmarks or tags, otherwise you will not be able to search globally, and you will not be able to rename and delete them in the bookmarks/tags panel. The "special symbols" here include: `*`, `_`, `[`, `]`, `!`, `\`, `` ` `` , `<`, `>`, `&`, `~ `, `$`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `=` and `#`.
