# Import and Export

## Import

### Markdown

SiYuan supports importing Markdown files. So if you need to import data from other note-taking software, please convert the data into Markdown files first.

If the image syntax (local relative path) like `![foo](images/bar.png)` is encountered during import, SiYuan will convert `images/bar.png` into assets[^1]. But if it is `.images/bar.png`, it will not be converted, because the path files starting with `.` are hidden files, SiYuan will not process them.

If you need to recognize some extended syntax (such as superscript `^foo^`, subscript `~foo~`, tag `#foo` and formula `$foo$`, etc.), please open <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>Markdown syntax</kbd> related switches.

### Data

You can import and export data in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Export</kbd> on the desktop-end and <kbd>About</kbd> on the right sidebar on the mobile-end. The export here will completely copy and pack the `workspace/data/` folder into a zip archive.

The <kbd>Import Data</kbd> function only supports processing the data archive exported in the above steps. The import is copied to the current `workspace/data/` folder according to the file path in the archive:

- Duplicate files are overwritten
- Add files that do not exist
- Do not do any processing for existing files

#Note#: Please pay attention before use, to avoid existing data being overwritten and unrecoverable.

## Export

### Edit content copy

After selecting the content, use the copy shortcut <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, and the clipboard is standard Markdown text.

If you need to copy HTML content, please switch to <kbd>Export Preview</kbd> from <kbd>Toogle Mode</kbd> in the <kbd>︙</kbd> menu in the upper right corner of the editor tab before copying.

### Full text export

After selecting the document on the document tree, right-click and select <kbd>Export</kbd> or select <kbd>Export</kbd> from the <kbd>︙</kbd> menu in the upper right corner of the editor tab:

- Markdown
- PDF
- HTML
- Word .docx

There are some options in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Export</kbd> to configure export processing, please refer to the prompt information on this interface for details.

[^1]: # Assets

    ## Overview

    Attachments inserted through the editor will be regarded as asset files and will be placed in the `workspace/data/assets/` folder by default.

    ## Insert picture or file

    In the editor, you can directly paste the copied picture or file in the system clipboard (not supported on Linux), or insert it by dragging and dropping the picture or file into the editor. There are two options when inserting:

    - Copy as an asset and insert: Copy a picture or file as a resource file and insert, shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>​
    - Use `file://` absolute path and link: Insert a picture or file into a hyperlink as a local absolute path, shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, or hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and drag in

    For pictures, if a picture title is specified during layout, the title will be rendered below the picture as a legend.

    ​#Note#: Inserting pictures will not be compressed, and all pictures and files will be saved as original data.  

    ## Cleanup unreferenced assets

    A "Reference" refers to a link to a asset file via a hyperlink, an inserted image, or the `src` attribute of an HTML tag (such as `<img>`, `<iframe>`). There are two cases here:

    1. Reference to a specific asset file, such as a picture or a file
    2. Reference to a asset folder (a subfolder under the assets folder) must end with `/`, such as `[foo](assets/bar/)`. If a asset folder is referenced, all the following asset files will be counted as already referenced regardless of whether they are individually referenced

    In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, you can clean up unreferenced assets by one-click. If you need to retrieve files that have been deleted by mistake, please via Rollback[^2].

    ​#Note#: Using absolute paths (local or network paths) will not be included Clean up calculations.

    ## List missing assets

    You can view the missing resources in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, and you can find the references in the global search after copying the path.

    ​#Note#: To search asset paths, you need to enable <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Search</kbd> - <kbd>Index</kbd> - <kbd>Asset Path</kbd>.

    ## Notebook-level assets

    If you need to place the inserted assets in the assets folder at the same level as the document by default, you need to manually create a folder named assets first, so that SiYuan will preferentially select the assets folder to store the assets.

    It is recommended not to use notebook-level assets as much as possible, as this has some side effects:

    - When deleting the doc, the assets referenced by the doc will be copied to the global assets in batches to ensure the normal operation of cross-notebook asset references
    - Does not support viewing notebook-level assets history in data history
    - Dose not support search by `/Assets`
    - Dose not support rename

    ## Image OCR to extract text

    This feature is only supported on the desktop, and the *Tesseract OCR* program needs to be manually installed first. 

    ​#Note#:

    - When installing Tesseract OCR, you need to check the language pack you need, and add the installed Tesseract-OCR directory path to the environment variable `PATH`, so that SiYuan can directly call the `tesseract` command to extract text from image OCR. If the installation is normal, you can search for `tesseract-ocr enabled` in the kernel boot log; If you want to disable OCR, set the environment variable `SIYUAN\_TESSERACT\_ENABLED=false`​
    - SiYuan does not enable all installed language packs, because too many language packs will cause OCR to be slow or even timeout and return empty results, and take up too many system resources, so by default only `eng`​, `chi*`​, `fra`​, `spa`​, `deu`​, `rus`​ and `osd`​ will be enabled at most, if you need more accurate language support, you can specify the language pack by configuring the environment variable `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_LANGS`​, such as `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_LANGS=chi_sim+eng`​
    - Only images in png and jpg formats are supported
    - By default, only images below 2MB are processed. If you need to adjust, you can set the environment variable `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_MAX_SIZE`​, the unit of value is bytes, for example: `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_MAX_SIZE=4000000`​ adjust the upper limit to 4MB

    Image OCR extracts text automatically in the background, currently only supports PNG and JPG images. The extracted text is used in the search function, so that images can be located by text keywords.

    ### Manually adjust OCR results

    The OCR results are saved in `workspace/data/assets/ocr-texts.json`, and the OCR results can be adjusted in the following ways:

    - After exiting SiYuan, modify the file on the file system (please pay attention to the correctness of the JSON format)
    - Or select <kbd>OCR</kbd> from the image element menu in the editor

    After the adjustment, you need to manually rebuild the index.


[^2]: ## Rollback through file history

    In the time list column on the left side of the data history interface, there is a rollback button on the right side of each history record. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing file will be overwritten with the file history.

    If there are very many files that need to be rolled back, it is recommended to manually copy on the file system. The internal structure of the history folder is the same as the internal structure of data, for example:

    - Notebook delete: `2022-05-01-091021-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/`, i.e. `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/`
    - Document deletion: `2022-05-01-091209-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/20200812220555-lj3enxa.sy`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/{document path}`
    - Asset file cleanup: `2022-05-01-095621-clean/assets/image-20220501091157-qccp87e.png`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/assets/{asset file name}`

    Manual rollback steps:

    1. Exit SiYuan, and then make a full copy and backup of the entire workspace to avoid data loss caused by subsequent misoperations
    2. Go to the `workspace/history/` folder and copy the data in the `historical generation date-{operation}` folder directly to the data folder for overwriting
    3. Reindex manually after starting SiYuan

    ### Clean up file history

    By default, the history of files generated in the last 30 days is automatically saved, which can be adjusted through <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Retention Days</kbd>. History will be automatically deleted.

    If you want to clear all file history data, you can click <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>Clear all history</kbd>, or manually delete the `workspace/history/` folder, then <kbd>Reindex</kbd> in <kbd>File History</kbd>.
