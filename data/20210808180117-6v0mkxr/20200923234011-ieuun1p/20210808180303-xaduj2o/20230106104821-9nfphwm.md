# Workspace

## Overview

The workspace is used to save data, history, configuration and files needed at runtime.

- Different workspaces are isolated from each other by file system folders
- A workspace can only be served by one kernel process

## Switch workspace

- On the desktop, multiple workspaces can be opened in the drop-down menu on the left side of the top bar

  If your multiple workspaces need to be started frequently, you can consider creating a different startup entry for each workspace and specify the startup parameter `--workspace="Absolute-path-of-the-workspace"`(Please use `"` to enclose the path). For example, multiple shortcuts can be copied on a Windows system, and each Shortcut - Property - Target is followed by a workspace path parameter, such as `--workspace="F:\SiYuan"`. In addition, you can also pass `--port=12345` to specify the port that the kernel listens to.
- On the mobile, we can switch between different workspaces in <kbd>About</kbd> in the right colum panel

## File system structure

The structure under the workspace on the file system:

- ​`conf` is used to save the workspace configuration
- ​`corrupted` is used to save corrupted data files
- ​`data` is used to save data, please refer to here[^1] for the specific structure
- ​`history` is used to save file history
- ​`repo` is used to save data warehouse data
- ​`temp` is used to save temporary files needed at runtime
- ​`.lock` This file will be created after the kernel process starts to lock the workspace

[^1]: - ​`assets` is used to save all inserted assets[^2]
    - ​`emojis` is used to save emoji images
    - ​`snippets` is used to save code snippets
    - ​`storage` is used to save query conditions, layouts and flashcards[^4], etc.
    - ​`templates` is used to save template snippets[^5]
    - ​`widgets` is used to save widgets[^6]
    - ​`plugins` is used to save plugins[^7]
    - ​`public` is used to save public data
    - The rest of the folders are the notebook folders created by the user, files with the suffix of `.sy`​​​ in the notebook folder are used to save the document data, and the data format is JSON


[^2]: # Assets

    ## Overview

    Attachments inserted through the editor will be regarded as asset files and will be placed in the `workspace/data/assets/` folder by default.

    ## Insert picture or file

    In the editor, you can directly paste the copied picture or file in the system clipboard (not supported on Linux), or insert it by dragging and dropping the picture or file into the editor. There are two options when inserting:

    - Copy as an asset and insert: Copy a picture or file as a resource file and insert, shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>​
    - Use `file://` absolute path and link: Insert a picture or file into a hyperlink as a local absolute path, shortcut key <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>, or hold down <kbd>Alt</kbd> and drag in

    For pictures, if a picture title is specified during layout, the title will be rendered below the picture as a legend.

    ![siyuan-128.png](assets/siyuan-128-20210604092437-7iqzf90.png "When one drinks water, one must not forget where it comes from")

    ​#Note#: Inserting pictures will not be compressed, and all pictures and files will be saved as original data.  

    ## Cleanup unreferenced assets

    A "Reference" refers to a link to a asset file via a hyperlink, an inserted image, or the `src` attribute of an HTML tag (such as `<img>`, `<iframe>`). There are two cases here:

    1. Reference to a specific asset file, such as a picture or a file
    2. Reference to a asset folder (a subfolder under the assets folder) must end with `/`, such as `[foo](assets/bar/)`. If a asset folder is referenced, all the following asset files will be counted as already referenced regardless of whether they are individually referenced

    In <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, you can clean up unreferenced assets by one-click. If you need to retrieve files that have been deleted by mistake, please via Rollback[^3].

    ​#Note#: Using absolute paths (local or network paths) will not be included Clean up calculations.

    ## List missing assets

    You can view the missing resources in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Assets</kbd>, and you can find the references in the global search after copying the path.

    ​#Note#: To search asset paths, you need to enable <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Search</kbd> - <kbd>Index</kbd> - <kbd>Asset Path</kbd>.

    ## Notebook-level assets

    If you need to place the inserted assets in the assets folder at the same level as the document by default, you need to manually create a folder named assets first, so that SiYuan will preferentially select the assets folder to store the assets.

    It is recommended not to use notebook-level assets as much as possible, as this has some side effects:

    - When deleting the doc, the assets referenced by the doc will be copied to the global assets in batches to ensure the normal operation of cross-notebook asset references
    - Does not support viewing notebook-level assets history in data history
    - Dose not support search by `/Assets`
    - Dose not support rename

    ## Image OCR to extract text

    This feature is only supported on the desktop, and the *Tesseract OCR* program needs to be manually installed first. 

    ​#Note#:

    - When installing Tesseract OCR, you need to check the language pack you need, and add the installed Tesseract-OCR directory path to the environment variable `PATH`, so that SiYuan can directly call the `tesseract` command to extract text from image OCR. If the installation is normal, you can search for `tesseract-ocr enabled` in the kernel boot log; If you want to disable OCR, set the environment variable `SIYUAN\_TESSERACT\_ENABLED=false`​
    - SiYuan does not enable all installed language packs, because too many language packs will cause OCR to be slow or even timeout and return empty results, and take up too many system resources, so by default only `eng`​, `chi*`​, `fra`​, `spa`​, `deu`​, `rus`​ and `osd`​ will be enabled at most, if you need more accurate language support, you can specify the language pack by configuring the environment variable `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_LANGS`​, such as `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_LANGS=chi_sim+eng`​
    - Only images in png and jpg formats are supported
    - By default, only images below 2MB are processed. If you need to adjust, you can set the environment variable `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_MAX_SIZE`​, the unit of value is bytes, for example: `SIYUAN_TESSERACT_MAX_SIZE=4000000`​ adjust the upper limit to 4MB

    Image OCR extracts text automatically in the background, currently only supports PNG and JPG images. The extracted text is used in the search function, so that images can be located by text keywords.

    ### Manually adjust OCR results

    The OCR results are saved in `workspace/data/assets/ocr-texts.json`, and the OCR results can be adjusted in the following ways:

    - After exiting SiYuan, modify the file on the file system (please pay attention to the correctness of the JSON format)
    - Or select <kbd>OCR</kbd> from the image element menu in the editor

    After the adjustment, you need to manually rebuild the index.


[^3]: ## Rollback through file history

    In the time list column on the left side of the data history interface, there is a rollback button on the right side of each history record. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing file will be overwritten with the file history.

    If there are very many files that need to be rolled back, it is recommended to manually copy on the file system. The internal structure of the history folder is the same as the internal structure of data, for example:

    - Notebook delete: `2022-05-01-091021-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/`, i.e. `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/`
    - Document deletion: `2022-05-01-091209-delete/20210808180117-czj9bvb/20200812220555-lj3enxa.sy`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/{notebook ID}/{document path}`
    - Asset file cleanup: `2022-05-01-095621-clean/assets/image-20220501091157-qccp87e.png`, which is `historical generation date-{operation}/assets/{asset file name}`

    Manual rollback steps:

    1. Exit SiYuan, and then make a full copy and backup of the entire workspace to avoid data loss caused by subsequent misoperations
    2. Go to the `workspace/history/` folder and copy the data in the `historical generation date-{operation}` folder directly to the data folder for overwriting
    3. Reindex manually after starting SiYuan

    ### Clean up file history

    By default, the history of files generated in the last 30 days is automatically saved, which can be adjusted through <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>History Retention Days</kbd>. History will be automatically deleted.

    If you want to clear all file history data, you can click <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Editor</kbd> - <kbd>Clear all history</kbd>, or manually delete the `workspace/history/` folder, then <kbd>Reindex</kbd> in <kbd>File History</kbd>.


[^4]: # Flashcards

    ## Overview

    After setting the content block as a flashcard, it will automatically arrange the review through the spaced repetition algorithm FSRS (github repo: open-spaced-repetition/free-spaced-repetition-scheduler).

    ## How to use

    ### Content Block

    Before starting the official card making, let us introduce some basic rules of card making:

    - ==mark== elements in content blocks will be treated as knockout answers
    - If a super block is set as a flashcard, the first sub-block of the super block will be regarded as a question, and the rest of the sub-blocks will be regarded as an answer
    - If a list or list item is set as a flashcard, non-sublists will be treated as questions and sublists will be treated as answers
    - If a heading block is set as a flashcard, the heading block will be treated as a question and the blocks below it will be treated answers

    The above rules can be adjusted in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>.

    ### Based on doc

    The document-based usage method does not need to pay attention to the card deck, and supports parent-child document review.

    - Select <kbd>Quick make card</kbd> in the block icon menu to make a card
    - Right-click the doc in the document tree panel or click the document block icon <kbd>Flashcard</kbd> in the editor to enter the review

    ### Based on card deck

    Based on the use of card deck, the content blocks in different documents can be carded and put into a unified card pack for review.

    - Select <kbd>Add to card deck...</kbd>​ in the block label menu, and then add the content block to a card deck to complete the card making
    - Access review by clicking <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>​ in the top bar menu

    This mode of use is disabled by default. If necessary, it can be enabled in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd> - <kbd>Deck</kbd>. However, it is not recommended to use flashcards based on card deck, because the card deck are fixed and not as flexible as using flashcards based on documents.

    ## Settings

    You can adjust the global configuration related to flashcards in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Flashcard</kbd>, including <kbd>New Card Limit</kbd> and <kbd>Old Card Limit</kbd> can be overridden using document block custom attributes:

    - ​`riff-new-card-limit`​
    - ​`riff-review-card-limit`​

    ![image](assets/image-20240128113001-pee8l86.png)

    They are configured separately on different documents and do not affect each other. For example, if the parent document is configured as 5 and the sub-document is 10, then it will be 5 when reviewing from the parent document, and the configuration of the sub-document will not be superimposed.

    ## ​#Note#​

    - After the content block is deleted (or the ID is changed), the corresponding flashcard will become invalid
    - It is not recommended to enable card decks. This method has been deprecated. If you continue to use it, you may encounter unsolvable problems

    ## Technical implementation

    - The card deck data is stored in the `workspace/data/storage/riff/` folder through the MessagePack serialization protocol
    - Load all card deck data to the memory at startup, and reload once after the data is downloaded synchronously


[^5]: # Template snippet

    ## Overview

    The template snippet is used to quickly insert the previously set text content at the cursor caret position, and it supports variables. Template snippets use `.md` suffix files and are stored in the data/templates folder of the workspace.

    ## Writing a template

    The template is implemented using [The Go Programming Language text template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). If you have an understanding of this, you can implement some program logic in it, such as comparison logic , Iterative logic, etc. In addition, to avoid syntax conflicts, template syntax uses `.action{action}` (instead of `{{action}}`).

    We have built-in variables and functions to enrich the template through the open source project Sprig (GitHub repo: Masterminds/sprig). For example, you can use `.action{now | date "2006-01-02 15:04:05"}` to render the current time. For more usage, please refer to [Sprig Function Documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

    There is a detail about the date and time formatting. #Note#: The formatting of the Go programming language is quite special: Instead of using `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`, use `2006-01-02 15:04: 05` This fixed time format ([related discussions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530327/origin-of-mon-jan-2-150405-mst-2006-in-golang)).

    In addition to the built-in variables and functions of Sprig, the following variables and functions are also supported:

    - ​`title`: Use this variable to insert the current document name. For example, if the template content is `# .action{.title}`, it will be inserted into the current document content with the first-level heading syntax after invoking
    - ​`id`：Use this variable to insert the current document id
    - ​`name`: Use this variable to insert the current document name
    - ​`alias`：Use this variable to insert the current document alias
    - ​`getHPathByID`: This function is used to return the readable path of the block corresponding to the block ID
    - ​`queryBlocks`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of blocks

      ```
      .action{$today := now | date "20060102150405"}
      .action{$blocks := queryBlocks "SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE content LIKE '?' AND updated > '?' LIMIT ?" "%foo%" $today "3"}
      ```
    - ​`getBlock`: This function is used to query the database based on the block ID, and the return value is block

      ```
      .action{getBlock "20250331163529-vixv1we"}
      ```
    - ​`querySpans`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of spans

      ```
       .action{querySpans "SELECT * FROM spans LIMIT ?" "3"}
      ```
    - ​`querySQL`: This function is used to query the database and the return value is a result set

      ```
       .action{querySQL "SELECT * FROM refs LIMIT 3"}
      ```
    - ​`statBlock`: This function is used to count the block content

      ```
      .action{ (statBlock .id).RuneCount} .action{ (statBlock .id).WordCount}
      ```
      - RuneCount
      - WordCount
      - LinkCount
      - ImageCount
      - RefCount
      - BlockCount
    - ​`runeCount`: This function is used to return the number of characters in a string
    - ​`wordCount`: This function is used to return the number of words in a string
    - ​`parseTime`: This function is used to parse a string in time format into a `time.Time` type so that more formatting methods can be used to render the time
    - ​`Weekday`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6`​
    - ​`WeekdayCN`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=日, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
    - ​`WeekdayCN2`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=天, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
    - ​`ISOWeek`: This function is used to return the week
    - ​`pow`: Exponential calculation, return an integer
    - ​`powf`: Exponential calculation, return a floating point number
    - ​`log`: Logarithmic calculation, returns an integer
    - ​`logf`: Logarithmic calculation, return a floating point number

    ## Invoke template

    At the cursor caret position, select the template via <kbd>/</kbd> to trigger the template search, find the template that needs to be inserted and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ## An example

    ```plaintext
    .action{$before := (div (now.Sub (toDate "2006-01-02" "2020-02-19")).Hours 24)}

    .action{$after := (div ((toDate "2006-01-02" "2048-02-19").Sub now).Hours 24)}
    Today is `.action{now | date "2006-01-02"}`.

    * `.action{$before}` days have passed since `2020-02-19`
    * There are `.action{$after}` days left from `2048-02-19`
    ```
    `$before` and `$after` define two variables to record the number of days from the current date to 2020 and 2048, respectively.

[^6]: # Widgets

    ## Overview

    The widget is a static webpage served by SiYuan Kernel. It accesses data through API and renders it through `<iframe>`.

    Compared with plugins[^7], a widget is a kind of content block, which follows the indexing and rendering rules of the block. The widget is mainly oriented to content block extension, not to program function extension.

    ## How to use

    The widgets are installed through the widget marketplace. After installation, the widgets will be placed in the `workspace/widgets/` folder. In the editor, use the slash menu to trigger the call search. After selecting the widget you need, the widget will be inserted into the document in the form of a widget block.

[^7]: # Plugins

    ## Overview

    Plugins are mainly used to expand the overall functions of SiYuan.

    Compared with widgets[^6], the plugin is mainly for program function extension, not for content block extension.

    ## How to use

    The plugin is installed through the plugin marketplace. After installation, the plugin will be placed in the folder `workspace/plugins/`. You can enable or disable plugins in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> - <kbd>Downloaded</kbd> - <kbd>Plugin</kbd>.
