# Template snippet

## Overview

The template snippet is used to quickly insert the previously set text content at the cursor caret position, and it supports variables. Template snippets use `.md` suffix files and are stored in the data/templates folder of the workspace.

## Writing a template

The template is implemented using [The Go Programming Language text template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). If you have an understanding of this, you can implement some program logic in it, such as comparison logic , Iterative logic, etc. In addition, to avoid syntax conflicts, template syntax uses `.action{action}` (instead of `{{action}}`).

We have built-in variables and functions to enrich the template through the open source project Sprig (GitHub repo: Masterminds/sprig). For example, you can use `.action{now | date "2006-01-02 15:04:05"}` to render the current time. For more usage, please refer to [Sprig Function Documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

There is a detail about the date and time formatting. #Note#: The formatting of the Go programming language is quite special: Instead of using `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`, use `2006-01-02 15:04: 05` This fixed time format ([related discussions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530327/origin-of-mon-jan-2-150405-mst-2006-in-golang)).

In addition to the built-in variables and functions of Sprig, the following variables and functions are also supported:

- ​`title`: Use this variable to insert the current document name. For example, if the template content is `# .action{.title}`, it will be inserted into the current document content with the first-level heading syntax after invoking
- ​`id`：Use this variable to insert the current document id
- ​`name`: Use this variable to insert the current document name
- ​`alias`：Use this variable to insert the current document alias
- ​`getHPathByID`: This function is used to return the readable path of the block corresponding to the block ID
- ​`queryBlocks`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of blocks

  ```
  .action{$today := now | date "20060102150405"}
  .action{$blocks := queryBlocks "SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE content LIKE '?' AND updated > '?' LIMIT ?" "%foo%" $today "3"}
  ```
- ​`getBlock`: This function is used to query the database based on the block ID, and the return value is block

  ```
  .action{getBlock "20250331163529-vixv1we"}
  ```
- ​`querySpans`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of spans

  ```
   .action{querySpans "SELECT * FROM spans LIMIT ?" "3"}
  ```
- ​`querySQL`: This function is used to query the database and the return value is a result set

  ```
   .action{querySQL "SELECT * FROM refs LIMIT 3"}
  ```
- ​`statBlock`: This function is used to count the block content

  ```
  .action{ (statBlock .id).RuneCount} .action{ (statBlock .id).WordCount}
  ```

  - RuneCount
  - WordCount
  - LinkCount
  - ImageCount
  - RefCount
  - BlockCount
- ​`runeCount`: This function is used to return the number of characters in a string
- ​`wordCount`: This function is used to return the number of words in a string
- ​`parseTime`: This function is used to parse a string in time format into a `time.Time` type so that more formatting methods can be used to render the time
- ​`Weekday`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6`​
- ​`WeekdayCN`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=日, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
- ​`WeekdayCN2`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=天, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
- ​`ISOWeek`: This function is used to return the week
- ​`pow`: Exponential calculation, return an integer
- ​`powf`: Exponential calculation, return a floating point number
- ​`log`: Logarithmic calculation, returns an integer
- ​`logf`: Logarithmic calculation, return a floating point number

## Invoke template

At the cursor caret position, select the template via <kbd>/</kbd> to trigger the template search, find the template that needs to be inserted and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## An example

```plaintext
.action{$before := (div (now.Sub (toDate "2006-01-02" "2020-02-19")).Hours 24)}

.action{$after := (div ((toDate "2006-01-02" "2048-02-19").Sub now).Hours 24)}
Today is `.action{now | date "2006-01-02"}`.

* `.action{$before}` days have passed since `2020-02-19`
* There are `.action{$after}` days left from `2048-02-19`
```

`$before` and `$after` define two variables to record the number of days from the current date to 2020 and 2048, respectively.
