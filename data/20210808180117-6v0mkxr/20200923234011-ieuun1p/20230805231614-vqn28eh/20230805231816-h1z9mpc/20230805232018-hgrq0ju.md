# Connect with third-party cloud storage

Please configure in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud Storage Provider</kbd>, currently supported:

- S3 compatible object storage services, such as [Qiniu](https://s.qiniu.com/VbQfeu), [Aliyun OSS](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss?userCode=yqovuas2), [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
- WebDAV protocol, such as [InfiniCLOUD](https://infini-cloud.net/), [Koofr](https://koofr.eu/)

  - Due to the problems of the WebDAV protocol itself, when the data volume is large, problems such as slow startup, slow synchronization, and high resource usage will occur, so it is recommended to use S3 object storage
  - Nutstore cloud WebDAV is not supported because its [interface has limitations](https://help.jianguoyun.com/?p=2064)
- Local file system

Synchronizing data through third-party cloud storage services is also end-to-end encrypted[^1], and third-party cloud storage service providers cannot obtain our plaintext data.

â€‹#Note#: In order to ensure the availability of data synchronization, please ensure:

- The system time of multiple devices is consistent, please control the deviation within one minute
- The network is stable (For example, in mainland China, please do not use services in non-mainland China)
- Do not enable CDN

[^1]: ## End-to-end Encryption

    Data synchronization is transmitted through end-to-end encryption, and the cloud does not store any plaintext data.

    - The key is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to the cloud
    - Encryption and decryption process is performed entirely on the local device
    - The encryption algorithm is the industry-recognized and secure AES GCM
