# Storage

The cloud storage space is `8G`, divided into the following sections:

- Syn data: Provided to the synchronization function, the data is encrypted
- Backup data: Provided to the backup function, the data is encrypted
- Assets: Provided for copying to the Wechat MP, Zhihu and Yuque, etc., HTTPS CDN

Usage can be viewed in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd>.

## End-to-end Encryption

Data synchronization is transmitted through end-to-end encryption, and the cloud does not store any plaintext data.

- The key is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to the cloud
- Encryption and decryption process is performed entirely on the local device
- The encryption algorithm is the industry-recognized and secure AES GCM
