# Data backup

## Overview

Data backup refers to uploading Data snapshot[^1] to the cloud.

## How to use

1. After initializing the data repo key[^2], if all goes well, the backup has been configured
2. Open the <kbd>Data History</kbd> - <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd> tab, select the snapshot to be backed up and click <kbd>Tag Snapshot</kbd>
3. Select <kbd>Locally tag snapshot</kbd> in the filter drop-down list, select the snapshot to upload and click <kbd>Upload</kbd>
4. After the upload is complete, select <kbd>Cloud tag snapshot</kbd> from the filter drop-down list to see the snapshots just backed up to the cloud
5. After the snapshot of the cloud backup is downloaded to the local, you can restore the data by Rollback data snapshot[^3]

In addition:

- Ignore files
- The cloud supports saving up to 12 data snapshots

[^1]: ## Data snapshot

    ### Initialize key

    Before using the data snapshot for the first time, you need to initialize the <kbd>Data repo key</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>.

    There are three ways to initialize the key:

    - <kbd>Import Key</kbd>: Copy the key string from another device to this paste and import
    - <kbd>Auto-generate key</kbd>: Use random text to generate the key, this method only needs to be executed once on one device, and other devices use <kbd>Import key</kbd>
    - <kbd>Generate key by passphrase</kbd>: Use a custom passphrase to generate the key, which requires the same passphrase on all devices

    All in all, it is important to ensure that all devices use the same key, otherwise data snapshots will not be available across devices, such as syncing data snapshots through the cloud.

    ### Create data snapshot

    1. Click the <kbd>Data History</kbd> button on the top toolbar or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to open the data history interface
    2. Switch to the last tab <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd>
    3. Click <kbd>Create Snapshot</kbd>, fill in <kbd>Memo</kbd> and confirm

    When browsing data snapshots, you can only distinguish between the snapshot creation time and memo, so the memo should be as detailed as possible, so that different data snapshots can be accurately identified in the future.

    ### Browse data snapshot

    After creating a data snapshot, you can see the snapshot time list on the left, and click different snapshots to browse their notes.

    ### Rollback data snapshot

    There is a rollback button on the right side of the snapshot time list entry. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing data will be completely replaced with the snapshot data.

    ### Cleanup data snapshot

    - ​<kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd> - <kbd>Data repo purge</kbd> will delete all unreferenced snapshots and related data objects. "Referenced snapshots" refer to snapshots pointed to under repo/refs/:

      - ​`latest` points to the latest snapshot
      - ​`tags/*` point to manually tagged snapshots
    - Manually delete the `workspace/repo/` folder to clear all data snapshots

    ### Ignore files

    If you need to ignore some files during synchronization, please create or edit the text file `workspace/data/.siyuan/syncignore` on the file system, each line is configured with the relative path of the data folder, which means that the path of the file or folder is ignored and wildcard characters are supported. E.g:

    - `20210808180117-6v0mkxr/**/*`: Ignore the data/20210808180117-6v0mkxr notebook
    - `assets/*.pdf`: ignore PDF files under data/assets/

    ### #Note#

    - Symlinks and hidden files are not snapshotted

    There is a rollback button on the right side of the snapshot time list entry. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing data will be completely replaced with the snapshot data.
