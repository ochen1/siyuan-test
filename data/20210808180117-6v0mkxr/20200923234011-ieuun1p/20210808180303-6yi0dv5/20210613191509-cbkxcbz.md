# Content Block Attribute

## Overview

Attributes exist in the form of key-value pairs. We can enrich the connotation of the content block by setting attributes on the content block. Attributes are divided into built-in attributes and custom attributes.

## Built-in attributes

|Property name|Description|
| :-------------: | ---------------------------|
|name|Name of the content block|
|alias|Alias of content block|
|memo|Memo of the content block|
|bookmark|Bookmark of content block|

## Custom attributes

The user-defined attributes are set by the user through the <kbd>​`Block icon menu`​</kbd> -<kbd>​`Attribute`​</kbd>, and only English letters and Arabic numerals are allowed in the attribute name (such as `doing`, `7days`). After setting, SiYuan will automatically prefix the attribute name with `custom-` to distinguish built-in attributes from custom attributes.

## Query content blocks based on attributes

For example, when we set the properties of `progress=30` and `priority=2` for the content block, we can query all content blocks with a progress of 30 and a priority of 2 through SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM blocks
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT block_id
    FROM attributes AS a
    WHERE (a.name ='custom-progress' AND a.value = '30')
       OR (a.name ='custom-priority' AND a.value = '2')
    GROUP BY block_id
    HAVING count(block_id) = 2
);
```
