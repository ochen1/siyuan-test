[^1]: # Cloud Services

    Member's cloud services include:

    - Storage[^2]
    - Data sync[^3]
    - Data backup[^6]
    - Assets hosting[^9]
    - Inbox[^10]

    ​#Note#: Cloud service related limitations[^11].

    Member's cloud services require a paid subscription to use:

    - [Mainland China](https://ld246.com/subscribe/siyuan)
    - [Non-Mainland China](https://liuyun.io/subscribe/siyuan)


[^2]: # Storage

    The cloud storage space is `8G`, divided into the following sections:

    - Syn data: Provided to the synchronization function, the data is encrypted
    - Backup data: Provided to the backup function, the data is encrypted
    - Assets: Provided for copying to the Wechat MP, Zhihu and Yuque, etc., HTTPS CDN

    Usage can be viewed in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd>.

    ## End-to-end Encryption

    Data synchronization is transmitted through end-to-end encryption, and the cloud does not store any plaintext data.

    - The key is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to the cloud
    - Encryption and decryption process is performed entirely on the local device
    - The encryption algorithm is the industry-recognized and secure AES GCM

    ## FAQ

    ### Can developers decrypt my cloud data?

    Unable to decrypt. If you lose your key, no one (including developers) can help you recover your data from the cloud.


[^3]: # Data sync

    ## Overview

    Data synchronization refers to keeping the `workspace/data/` folder data consistent on multiple devices, includes assets, custom icons, plugins, code snippets, templates, widgets, and document data.

    ## How to use

    After initializing the data repo key[^4], if all goes well, the synchronization is already configured. If you are not familiar with synchronization configuration, it is recommended to open the synchronization configuration wizard by clicking the synchronization button. It is easier to configure through the wizard.

    - If you need to pause sync, you can turn off the option <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Enable cloud sync</kbd>
    - Ignore files[^5]

    ​#Note#​: 

    - Before enabling synchronization, please ensure that the system time of all devices participating in the synchronization is consistent
    - If the amount of data is large, it is recommended to export the data package through <kbd>Export Data</kbd> in the settings, and then send the data package to the new device by manual copying or other methods, and export the data package on the new device. Go to <kbd>Import Data</kbd>, and finally configure synchronization

    ## Synchronous mode

    Three synchronization modes are supported in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud Sync Mode</kbd>:

    - Auto

      - A synchronization will be performed when starting and exiting, and a synchronization will be performed 30 seconds after the data in use is no longer changed
      - Data merging and overwriting are determined by the synchronization algorithm, please refer to the following working principle introduction
    - Manual

      - Only one synchronization is performed when starting and exiting, and manual triggering of synchronization is required during use
      - Data merging and overwriting are determined by the synchronization algorithm, please refer to the following working principle introduction
    - Full manual sync: no sync at startup and exit, fully manual control of sync timing and sync direction

    ## How Auto/Manual mode works

    SiYuan performs corresponding operations by comparing cloud data snapshots and local data snapshots:

    - If the snapshots are the same, ignore this synchronization
    - If the snapshots are different, upload the local changes from the last sync to the cloud, and merge the latest changes from the cloud to the local

      - Merge directly if there is no conflict between the changes at both ends
      - If there is a file conflict, the local will overwrite the cloud, and the conflicting files from the cloud will be generated in the data history.

    The automatic synchronization time interval algorithm is described as follows:

    - After 30 seconds of data change, if there is no further change, a comparison will be made, and if it continues to change, it will be delayed by 30 seconds
    - If there is no data change, it will be incremented by 5 minutes, 8 minutes, 16 minutes, 32 minutes...

    ## Scenario example

    From the above working principle, we can know that SiYuan only supports alternate synchronization of data on multiple devices: after synchronization is completed on device A, synchronization is performed on device B. Simultaneous synchronization of multiple devices cannot be supported, so unexpected data overwriting will occur.

    ### Normal scenario

    1. Execute synchronization after editing on device A (by triggering synchronization automatically or manually), at this time, the cloud data will be overwritten by the data of device A, that is, the cloud and device A keep the same data
    2. Execute synchronization on device B. At this time, the data of device B will be overwritten by the cloud data, that is, the cloud and devices A and B keep the same data
    3. After editing on device B, perform synchronization again. At this time, the cloud data will be overwritten by device B data, that is, the cloud and device B keep the same data.
    4. Execute synchronization on device A. At this time, the data of device A will be overwritten by the cloud data, that is, the cloud and devices A and B keep the same data

    In this scenario, the process of using synchronization is performed alternately on devices A and B, which can ensure that data synchronization is completed normally as expected.

    ### Conflict scenario

    1. Sync after editing the file a on device A
    2. Sync after editing the file a on device B
    3. At this time, the cloud file a will be overwritten by a of the B device, and the history of the previous A device file a will be generated on the B device

    ## #Note#

    - Synchronization will not be triggered in the case of sudden disconnection such as sleep or shutdown, please manually click the synchronization button to synchronize
    - Do not use a third-party sync disk and SiYuan sync at the same time, it may cause data damage
    - Symbolic links and hidden files will not be synchronized
    - In the automatic synchronization mode, if you need to exit, please use the normal exit method (for example, do not use sliding to remove on the mobile APP, do not use the end process to force close on the desktop) to ensure data sync
    - If the data snapshot takes more than 12 seconds before data synchronization, you will be prompted to clean up the data warehouse. If you need to change the default time, you can use the following two methods.

      - Environment variable `SIYUAN_SYNC_INDEX_TIMING`, for example `SIYUAN_SYNC_INDEX_TIMING=30000`, the unit is milliseconds
      - Directly modify `repo.syncIndexTiming` in workspace/conf/conf.json

      The minimum value can only be configured to `12000` (12 seconds), and the maximum value is not limited; when starting, environment variables will be read first to overwrite the values in the conf file.


[^4]: ### Initialize key

    Before using the data snapshot for the first time, you need to initialize the <kbd>Data repo key</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>.

    There are three ways to initialize the key:

    - <kbd>Import Key</kbd>: Copy the key string from another device to this paste and import
    - <kbd>Auto-generate key</kbd>: Use random text to generate the key, this method only needs to be executed once on one device, and other devices use <kbd>Import key</kbd>
    - <kbd>Generate key by passphrase</kbd>: Use a custom passphrase to generate the key, which requires the same passphrase on all devices

    All in all, it is important to ensure that all devices use the same key, otherwise data snapshots will not be available across devices, such as syncing data snapshots through the cloud.


[^5]: ### Ignore files

    If you need to ignore some files during synchronization, please create or edit the text file `workspace/data/.siyuan/syncignore` on the file system, each line is configured with the relative path of the data folder, which means that the path of the file or folder is ignored and wildcard characters are supported. E.g:

    - `20210808180117-6v0mkxr/**/*`: Ignore the data/20210808180117-6v0mkxr notebook
    - `assets/*.pdf`: ignore PDF files under data/assets/


[^6]: # Data backup

    ## Overview

    Data backup refers to uploading Data snapshot[^7] to the cloud.

    ## How to use

    1. After initializing the data repo key[^4], if all goes well, the backup has been configured
    2. Open the <kbd>Data History</kbd> - <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd> tab, select the snapshot to be backed up and click <kbd>Tag Snapshot</kbd>
    3. Select <kbd>Locally tag snapshot</kbd> in the filter drop-down list, select the snapshot to upload and click <kbd>Upload</kbd>
    4. After the upload is complete, select <kbd>Cloud tag snapshot</kbd> from the filter drop-down list to see the snapshots just backed up to the cloud
    5. After the snapshot of the cloud backup is downloaded to the local, you can restore the data by Rollback data snapshot[^8]

    In addition:

    - Ignore files
    - The cloud supports saving up to 12 data snapshots


[^7]: ## Data snapshot

    ### Initialize key

    Before using the data snapshot for the first time, you need to initialize the <kbd>Data repo key</kbd> in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd>.

    There are three ways to initialize the key:

    - <kbd>Import Key</kbd>: Copy the key string from another device to this paste and import
    - <kbd>Auto-generate key</kbd>: Use random text to generate the key, this method only needs to be executed once on one device, and other devices use <kbd>Import key</kbd>
    - <kbd>Generate key by passphrase</kbd>: Use a custom passphrase to generate the key, which requires the same passphrase on all devices

    All in all, it is important to ensure that all devices use the same key, otherwise data snapshots will not be available across devices, such as syncing data snapshots through the cloud.

    ### Create data snapshot

    1. Click the <kbd>Data History</kbd> button on the top toolbar or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> to open the data history interface
    2. Switch to the last tab <kbd>Data snapshot</kbd>
    3. Click <kbd>Create Snapshot</kbd>, fill in <kbd>Memo</kbd> and confirm

    When browsing data snapshots, you can only distinguish between the snapshot creation time and memo, so the memo should be as detailed as possible, so that different data snapshots can be accurately identified in the future.

    ### Browse data snapshot

    After creating a data snapshot, you can see the snapshot time list on the left, and click different snapshots to browse their notes.

    ### Rollback data snapshot

    There is a rollback button on the right side of the snapshot time list entry. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing data will be completely replaced with the snapshot data.

    ### Cleanup data snapshot

    - ​<kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>About</kbd> - <kbd>Data repo purge</kbd> will delete all unreferenced snapshots and related data objects. "Referenced snapshots" refer to snapshots pointed to under repo/refs/:

      - ​`latest` points to the latest snapshot
      - ​`tags/*` point to manually tagged snapshots
    - Manually delete the `workspace/repo/` folder to clear all data snapshots

    ### Ignore files

    If you need to ignore some files during synchronization, please create or edit the text file `workspace/data/.siyuan/syncignore` on the file system, each line is configured with the relative path of the data folder, which means that the path of the file or folder is ignored and wildcard characters are supported. E.g:

    - `20210808180117-6v0mkxr/**/*`: Ignore the data/20210808180117-6v0mkxr notebook
    - `assets/*.pdf`: ignore PDF files under data/assets/

    ### #Note#

    - Symlinks and hidden files are not snapshotted


[^8]: ### Rollback data snapshot

    There is a rollback button on the right side of the snapshot time list entry. After clicking, a confirmation dialog box will pop up. If the rollback is confirmed, the existing data will be completely replaced with the snapshot data.


[^9]: # Assets hosting

    SiYuan provides cloud assets hosting, which is mainly used to copy documents and asset files to platforms such as WeChat MP, Zhihu and Yuque. The editors of these platforms will automatically pull resource files to their platforms when pasting.

    ## How to use

    1. In the upper right corner of the document, select <kbd>︙</kbd> in the More menu and select <kbd>Upload asset files to cloud</kbd>​
    2. Select <kbd>Export Preview</kbd> in <kbd>Toogle Mode</kbd>
    3. Click <kbd>Copy to Wechat MP</kbd>, <kbd>Copy to Zhihu</kbd> or <kbd>Copy to Yuque</kbd>
    4. Paste into the target platform editor

    If you need to delete the files in the cloud assets hosting, please go to [LiuYun - Settings - File - Note](https://liuyun.io/settings/file?type=3) to operate. After deletion, the cloud storage space occupied by the file will be released immediately, but the CDN cache cleaning may not take effect in time, which will cause the file URL to remain accessible until the CDN cache expires automatically after 30 days.

    ## #Note#

    - Please do not directly use the external link address provided by cloud assets on other platforms. This address is unstable and may affect the availability due to the domain name change
    - Please do not upload illegal or sensitive files. The uploaded files will be reviewed through services provided by third parties (pornography, violent terrorism, sensitive people, etc.). If a user is found to upload illegal files, the user account will be permanently banned, and the corresponding legal responsibility will be assumed

[^12]: # Function Features

    Membership function features include:

    - Connect with third-party cloud storage[^13]
    - Search asset content[^15]

    Membership functions need to be paid before they can be used:

    - [Mainland China](https://ld246.com/one-time-pay/siyuan)
    - [Non-Mainland China](https://liuyun.io/one-time-pay/siyuan)


[^13]: # Connect with third-party cloud storage

    Please configure in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud</kbd> - <kbd>Cloud Storage Provider</kbd>, currently supported:

    - S3 compatible object storage services, such as [Qiniu](https://s.qiniu.com/VbQfeu), [Aliyun OSS](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss?userCode=yqovuas2), [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
    - WebDAV protocol, such as [InfiniCLOUD](https://infini-cloud.net/), [Koofr](https://koofr.eu/)

      - Due to the problems of the WebDAV protocol itself, when the data volume is large, problems such as slow startup, slow synchronization, and high resource usage will occur, so it is recommended to use S3 object storage
      - Nutstore cloud WebDAV is not supported because its [interface has limitations](https://help.jianguoyun.com/?p=2064)
    - Local file system

    Synchronizing data through third-party cloud storage services is also end-to-end encrypted[^14], and third-party cloud storage service providers cannot obtain our plaintext data.

    ​#Note#: In order to ensure the availability of data synchronization, please ensure:

    - The system time of multiple devices is consistent, please control the deviation within one minute
    - The network is stable (For example, in mainland China, please do not use services in non-mainland China)
    - Do not enable CDN


[^14]: ## End-to-end Encryption

    Data synchronization is transmitted through end-to-end encryption, and the cloud does not store any plaintext data.

    - The key is only stored locally and will not be uploaded to the cloud
    - Encryption and decryption process is performed entirely on the local device
    - The encryption algorithm is the industry-recognized and secure AES GCM


[^15]: # Search asset content
