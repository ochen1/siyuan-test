​#Note#:

- If plugins or external extensions require direct reading or writing of files under the `data` directory, please use the kernel API to achieve this. **Do not call** **​`fs`​** **or other electron or nodejs APIs directly**, as it may result in data loss during synchronization and cause damage to cloud data. Related APIs can be found at: `/api/file/*` (e.g., `/api/file/getFile`)
- When creating a daily note in SiYuan, a custom-dailynote-yyyymmdd attribute will be automatically added to the document to distinguish it from regular documents.

  > For more details, please refer to Github Issue #9807.
  >

  Developers should pay attention to the following when developing the functionality to manually create Daily Notes:

  - If `/api/filetree/createDailyNote` is called to create a daily note, the attribute will be automatically added to the document, and developers do not need to handle it separately
  - If a document is created manually by developer's code (e.g., using the `createDocWithMd` API to create a daily note), please manually add this attribute to the document

[^1]: # Theme

    ## Overview

    There are two ways to customize the theme:

    - Code snippet
    - Theme pack

    ## Code snippet

    1. Go to <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Appearance</kbd> and click  <kbd>Code Snippet</kbd>, select CSS tab
    2. Input title
    3. According to the theme and the variables in theme.css, refer to the following writing method to encode and fill in the code snippet

        ```css
        html[data-light-theme="daylight"][data-theme-mode="light"] {
            --b3-theme-primary: red;
        }

        html[data-light-theme="daylight"][data-theme-mode="dark"] {
            --b3-theme-primary: blue;
        }
        ```
    4. Enable this code snippet
    5. Click the Confirm button

[^3]: # Widgets

    ## Overview

    The widget is a static webpage served by SiYuan Kernel. It accesses data through API and renders it through `<iframe>`.

    Compared with plugins[^4], a widget is a kind of content block, which follows the indexing and rendering rules of the block. The widget is mainly oriented to content block extension, not to program function extension.

    ## How to use

    The widgets are installed through the widget marketplace. After installation, the widgets will be placed in the `workspace/widgets/` folder. In the editor, use the slash menu to trigger the call search. After selecting the widget you need, the widget will be inserted into the document in the form of a widget block.

    ## Push to widget marketplace

    Please refer to [Community marketplace repo](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/community.html).


[^4]: # Plugins

    ## Overview

    Plugins are mainly used to expand the overall functions of SiYuan.

    Compared with Widget[^3], the plugin is mainly for program function extension, not for content block extension.

    ## How to use

    The plugin is installed through the plugin marketplace. After installation, the plugin will be placed in the folder `workspace/plugins/`. You can enable or disable plugins in <kbd>Settings</kbd> - <kbd>Marketplace</kbd> - <kbd>Downloaded</kbd> - <kbd>Plugin</kbd>.

    ## Push on plugin marketplace

    Please refer to [Community marketplace repo](https://b3log.org/siyuan/en/community.html).


[^5]: # Template snippet

    ## Overview

    The template snippet is used to quickly insert the previously set text content at the cursor caret position, and it supports variables. Template snippets use `.md` suffix files and are stored in the data/templates folder of the workspace.

    ## Writing a template

    The template is implemented using [The Go Programming Language text template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). If you have an understanding of this, you can implement some program logic in it, such as comparison logic , Iterative logic, etc. In addition, to avoid syntax conflicts, template syntax uses `.action{action}` (instead of `{{action}}`).

    We have built-in variables and functions to enrich the template through the open source project Sprig (GitHub repo: Masterminds/sprig). For example, you can use `.action{now | date "2006-01-02 15:04:05"}` to render the current time. For more usage, please refer to [Sprig Function Documentation](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/).

    There is a detail about the date and time formatting. #Note#: The formatting of the Go programming language is quite special: Instead of using `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`, use `2006-01-02 15:04: 05` This fixed time format ([related discussions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20530327/origin-of-mon-jan-2-150405-mst-2006-in-golang)).

    In addition to the built-in variables and functions of Sprig, the following variables and functions are also supported:

    - ​`title`: Use this variable to insert the current document name. For example, if the template content is `# .action{.title}`, it will be inserted into the current document content with the first-level heading syntax after invoking
    - ​`id`：Use this variable to insert the current document id
    - ​`name`: Use this variable to insert the current document name
    - ​`alias`：Use this variable to insert the current document alias
    - ​`getHPathByID`: This function is used to return the readable path of the block corresponding to the block ID
    - ​`queryBlocks`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of blocks

      ```
      .action{$today := now | date "20060102150405"}
      .action{$blocks := queryBlocks "SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE content LIKE '?' AND updated > '?' LIMIT ?" "%foo%" $today "3"}
      ```
    - ​`getBlock`: This function is used to query the database based on the block ID, and the return value is block

      ```
      .action{getBlock "20250331163529-vixv1we"}
      ```
    - ​`querySpans`: This function is used to query the database, and the return value is a list of spans

      ```
       .action{querySpans "SELECT * FROM spans LIMIT ?" "3"}
      ```
    - ​`querySQL`: This function is used to query the database and the return value is a result set

      ```
       .action{querySQL "SELECT * FROM refs LIMIT 3"}
      ```
    - ​`statBlock`: This function is used to count the block content

      ```
      .action{ (statBlock .id).RuneCount} .action{ (statBlock .id).WordCount}
      ```
      - RuneCount
      - WordCount
      - LinkCount
      - ImageCount
      - RefCount
      - BlockCount
    - ​`runeCount`: This function is used to return the number of characters in a string
    - ​`wordCount`: This function is used to return the number of words in a string
    - ​`parseTime`: This function is used to parse a string in time format into a `time.Time` type so that more formatting methods can be used to render the time
    - ​`Weekday`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=0, Monday=1, ..., Saturday=6`​
    - ​`WeekdayCN`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=日, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
    - ​`WeekdayCN2`: This function is used to return the day of the week `Sunday=天, Monday=一, ..., Saturday=六`​
    - ​`ISOWeek`: This function is used to return the week
    - ​`pow`: Exponential calculation, return an integer
    - ​`powf`: Exponential calculation, return a floating point number
    - ​`log`: Logarithmic calculation, returns an integer
    - ​`logf`: Logarithmic calculation, return a floating point number

    ## Invoke template

    At the cursor caret position, select the template via <kbd>/</kbd> to trigger the template search, find the template that needs to be inserted and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    ## An example

    ```plaintext
    .action{$before := (div (now.Sub (toDate "2006-01-02" "2020-02-19")).Hours 24)}

    .action{$after := (div ((toDate "2006-01-02" "2048-02-19").Sub now).Hours 24)}
    Today is `.action{now | date "2006-01-02"}`.

    * `.action{$before}` days have passed since `2020-02-19`
    * There are `.action{$after}` days left from `2048-02-19`
    ```
    `$before` and `$after` define two variables to record the number of days from the current date to 2020 and 2048, respectively.
