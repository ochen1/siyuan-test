# Performance Optimization

## Overview

The performance on different hardware configurations and different operating system platforms is different. In addition, as the data increases, performance degradation is unavoidable. So we may need to change the way of use and adjust some configuration items to improve performance for a smoother experience.

### Overall Performance

- Number of content blocks: The number of content blocks has a large impact on performance, such as expanding the document tree, searching, and writing data. But don't worry too much, usually the number of content blocks in the order of millions will not have much impact, unless the size of each block is large
- System environment: the current load of the operating system will affect the overall performance
- Network environment: The network quality will affect the request response time when using <kbd>Network serving</kbd>​

Optimization suggestions:

- Put infrequently used documents or clipped documents separately into `Archive Notebook` or `Clipped Notebook`, after closing it, the number of database indexes will be reduced to improve performance
- Decrease <kbd>The number of search results displayed</kbd>, we will monitor the performance of the search request response time, if the response time exceeds the threshold, a pop-up will prompt the user to decrease the configuration item

  The performance monitoring threshold can be set through the environment variable `SIYUAN_PERFORMANCE_TIMING`, in milliseconds, and the default is 15000, which is 15 seconds
- Maintain sufficient system resources
- Using a solid-state drive, placing the workspace on a SSD can effectively improve overall performance
- Upgrade hardware, this is the fastest way to improve performance

### Editor Performance

- Leaf block size: The size of a single leaf block mainly affects the performance of the editor. If a leaf block contains a large number of characters, the editor may freeze
- The number of dynamically loaded blocks: The number of loaded blocks mainly affects the performance of the editor, especially for the case where there are many formula blocks, code blocks, and chart blocks. If more blocks are loaded, the editor may freeze
- Code block line number: The code block line number mainly affects the performance of the editor. If a code block has a lot of content and the line number display is turned on, the editor may freeze
- Formulas, images and charts: Formulas, images and charts mainly affect the performance of the editor. If the document contains a large number of formulas, images and charts, the editor may freeze

Optimization suggestions:

- Avoid using too many soft line breaks, although not using soft line breaks will increase the number of blocks, but using less soft line breaks can reduce the size of paragraph blocks and avoid editor lag
- Reduce <kbd>Number of dynamically loaded blocks</kbd>, especially for scenarios with many formula blocks, code blocks or chart blocks. There is no specific optimal value for this parameter, please refer to your experience after adjustment
- Improve editor performance by reducing elements with <kbd>Focus</kbd>​
